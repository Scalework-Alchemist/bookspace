<div Proposal>
<p>
            This part of the project is to help you narrow down your idea, clarify its parts and make it easier to start coding.

                The requirements are as follows.

                [_] Paragraph describing your app idea. What are you building? Who is it for?

                [_] An easily describable MVP. Remember you have a limited amount of time to develop this          project. What is the minimum you can get done on this project to meet the requirements         and get a product in someone's hand?

                [_] User Stories. What is a user going to do when they go to your site from the time they          hit the landing page? What features do they need and which are optional?

                [_] Wireframe. What is each page going to look like? What will be the layout, color scheme,        etc?

                [_] Mind Map. What is the structure of your backend and frontend app going to look like?           What  routes, models, components, actions, and reducers will you need? How will your data      be organized?

                [_] Once you have these items, you need to meet with your instructor to pass off your proposal     before you can start coding.
